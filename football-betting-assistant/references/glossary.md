**Single-Match Analysis**: Analysis focused on one football match and its available betting markets.

**Betting Portfolio**: A reference set of betting leans across more than one match. Analyze every confirmed match in the user's slate; apply ticket limits by market family rather than limiting the analysis slate.

**Match Result Market**: A market on home win, draw, or away win.

**Handicap Match Result Market**: A market on home win, draw, or away win after applying a stated goal handicap.

**Correct Score Market**: A market on the exact final score.

**Over-Under Market**: A market on whether total goals finish above or below a stated goal line such as 2.5, 2.75, or 3.0.

**Total Goals Market**: A market on a discrete total-goals bucket, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7+.

**Odds Data**: Market price and line information, including the source and observation time.

**Probability Analysis**: Outcome likelihood estimates that can be produced without odds data.

**Value Judgment**: An assessment of whether odds data appears favorable relative to estimated probabilities and risk. It requires verifiable odds data.

**Fixture Discovery**: Identifying concrete matches from natural-language requests, including teams, start time, competition, and venue context.

**Source Priority**: User-provided data first, configured data sources second, public web verification third, and user clarification when current data cannot be verified.

**Transparent Model**: A simplified explainable model using expected goals, Poisson distributions, Bayesian updates, and implied-probability checks without claiming black-box precision.

**Reference Grade**: A non-guaranteed confidence and value label: A, B, C, or Pass.

**Risk Tier**: Qualitative suitability for cautious, moderate, or speculative use. It is not bankroll allocation advice.

**Ticket Tier**: A reference purchase plan stated as unit count, unit price, total amount, structure, and selections. It is a formatting and coverage tool, not personalized stake sizing.

**More Combination Candidates**: Optional alternative combinations separated from the main ticket tiers. They are not mandatory additional purchases.

**Late Calibration**: Adjusting analysis with late-breaking context such as lineups, injuries, weather, schedule congestion, or odds movement.

**Score Candidate Set**: A fixed set of three correct-score candidates for one match: primary, secondary, and upset-aware.

**Data Confidence**: Completeness, freshness, and source agreement of collected data.

**Model Basis**: Concise explanation of expected goals, score concentration, Bayesian adjustments, and odds value comparison.
